Hello!

- I haven't accomplished all of the things in the criteria but I did the best as I can. I was able to tweak the design and the program a bit to make my website unique and add in more information about myself. I was also able to make my website responsive.
- I had trouble with the animations and the links throughout the program but I was able to complete the program thanks to the links given by Sir Job.

- The insights I’ve gathered while I was accomplishing the tasks given to me (LT1, M1M2) was it was a bit difficult in the beginning because I wasnt familiar anymore with HTML. Thanks to the instructions given by my professor, I was able to finish my tasks on time
   and I was able to learn a lot of new things about HTML and Java.

- I can improve my website in the future by adding more information about myself and adding more features and animations to make the website more appealing. This is my first time making a website like this and I can say that I learned a lot and I enjoyed every single bit.

- This activity was fun since I was able to finally make a personal website while still doing the things I love which is programming. I was also able to share the my hobbies and my other information on the website which made me happy since
  I like to motivate other people to work hard and enjoy life. I’m hoping to make more websites like this in the future.
